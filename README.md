## About

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA) advised by Dr. Nadiya Shvai. My research interests include reinforcement learning, robotics, and vision-language-action models.

Before my PhD, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering and Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at NaUKMA. There, I conducted research on Adversarial Sparsity in Attacks and Defenses for L-inf threat model. Apart from my academic pursuits, I work as a Head of AI at a Ukrainian startup with a focus on scalable LLM and Gen AI solutions.

I am also a senior lecturer at NaUKMA, where I teach undergraduate and graduate AI courses and supervise emerging talent. I actively support Ukraineâ€™s AI community by mentoring aspiring AI engineers, speaking at international conferences and events, and collaborating on cutting-edge research.
