## About

Machine Learning Research Engineer and a postgraduate student in Applied Mathematics at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. 

Research directions combine Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning focused in Healthcare and Assistive Technology. Recent projects include devising deep learning architectures for various domains such as spatiotemporal, audio, and textual data. Currently focusing on the Adversarial Robustness in Deep Learning models.

Keen on teaching and mentoring everyone interested in Machine Learning. Reading guest lectures, teaching mentees, and playing shogi - Japanese chess. 

Always open for new collaborations, hit me up with an email if you want to chat. You can find me at righteousronin.github.io.
