## About

I am a research engineer working at the intersection of reinforcement learning, robotics, and large foundation models, with an interest in developing efficient and human-centered intelligent systems.

I am a founding AI engineer and senior individual contributor at OnlyMonster, working on production LLM systems for real-time assistance, multilingual translation, safety, and AI-driven product features.

Alongside industry work, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at NaUKMA. My research focuses on efficient learning for perception, control, and human-robot interaction, including reinforcement learning distillation and quantization, safety and empathy in HRI, and modular mixture-of-experts approaches for foundation robotic models.

Much of my work sits at the boundary between academic research and deployed systems, with an emphasis on turning research ideas into methods and tools that can be evaluated, used, and iterated on in practice.
