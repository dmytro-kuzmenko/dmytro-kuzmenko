## About

I am a Data Science Engineering Manager at Litslink, where I lead a diverse team of more than 20 ML engineers across Computer Vision, NLP, Audio, and Generative AI domains. My work involves architecting complex machine learning solutions for PoCs and MVPs for a variety of clients, domains, and use cases.

I am also doing my PhD in CS at National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy (NaUKMA), where I work with Reinforcement Learning in Robotics and focus on efficiency and performance optimization. I also teach various courses such as Deep Learning for Computer Vision, Machine Learning, NLP systems, and Reinforcement Learning at NaUKMA and SET University.

I'm actively involved in the AI community, frequently speaking at conferences and events on topics ranging from applied machine learning to cutting-edge research in robotics. I'm committed to contributing to and growing the Ukrainian AI ecosystem through mentorship, public speaking, and collaborative research initiatives.
