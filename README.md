## About

I’m an AI and robotics researcher focused on building efficient, adaptive systems at the intersection of reinforcement learning, robotics, and foundation models. As Head of AI at OnlyMonster, I lead the development of generative and conversational AI products. I’m pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at NaUKMA, where my research centers on optimizing perception and control models. I am also exploring human-robot interaction to make AI systems more intuitive and responsive in real-world settings.
