## About

I am a Data Science Engineering Manager at LITSLINK, where I lead and supervise a team of 23 ML engineers. In this role, I have successfully architected and deployed multiple complex end-to-end machine learning pipelines, driving significant improvements in performance and scalability.

I am also pursuing a PhD in Robotics and Reinforcement Learning at NaUKMA, focusing on innovative research in cross-embodiment and sim-to-real transfer for robotic mobile manipulation tasks. My work aims to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world applications, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

As a senior lecturer at the Department of Multimedia Systems at NaUKMA, I teach courses in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning to undergraduate and graduate students. I am commited to mentoring and nurturing the next generation of Ukrainian AI talents. Additionally, I frequently speak at AI conferences and events and I aim to contribute to the broader Ukrainian AI community.
